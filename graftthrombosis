# Graft Thrombosis

#### Graft Patency Definitions
Primary patency: 					Bypass is patent without any subsequent intervention
Primary assisted patency:		Bypass undergoes a pre-emptive intervention such as a balloon or anastomotic revision. The graft has not thromboses
Secondary patency:				Thrombosed and is running again with either lysis or thrombectomy. With or without open revision or angioplasty.


Graft thrombosis is associated with significant rates of limb loss and morbidity. At 1 year following IIB failure 50% of patients will have undergone major amputation, 25% will have developed ulceration and 15% will have died.

Graft failures are grouped into either early and later (before or after 30 days). 

Interestingly those from the Veterans Affairs Medical Centre have demonstrated that endotracheal anaesthesia is associated with a higher rate of early graft failure. 

Late failure (especially after 6 months) is usually related to intimal hyerplasia or progression of the atherosclerotic process at the anastomosis or distal to bypass.

##### VR1
After IIB failure
* 50% mortality one year
* 25% ulceration (CLTI)
* 15% mortality

#### Assessing patency of graft prior to leaving the operating room.
The time of bypass is the critical moment in which one needs to assess conduit quality and assess bypass for technical issues. There are many postulated methods in which to do this, but the gold standard is angiography.

Other methods include
* Visual inspection with target organ in sterile field, usually in bag.
* Continuous wave doppler (hand-held probe)
* Ultrasonography (B Mode or with colour)
* Angioscopy
* Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS)


##### Is B-Mode a suitable method to assess graft patency?

B-Mode on its own has been used as a method to assess graft patency, but comes with a number of limitations 

1. You cannot tell the difference between fresh thrombus and blood flow which has the same echogenicity 

##### Kresowick
* 106 patients
* B Mode found defects in 20% of patients 
* Half of these defects were important enough to correct AND there were no early graft occlusions in this group

We used an ultrasound imaging system with a 10 MHz probe during 118 vascular procedures. These procedures included 56 cerebrovascular, 38 infrainguinal, 16 renal, 4 mesenteric, and 4 aortic reconstructions. In 29 procedures, intraoperative ultrasonography was used to supplement or replace preoperative arteriography to better define the extent of disease for the optimal placement of an anastomosis or to determine the need for an additional reconstructive procedure. In 106 cases, ultrasonography was used for postreconstruction assessment. Of the 21 (20%) defects found, 11 (10%) were deemed important enough to warrant correction. Defects were significantly more common following endarterectomy procedures (p < 0.01). All 11 of the major defects were successfully repaired, and neither the corrected defects nor the 10 uncorrected minor defects were associated with postoperative complications. Patients (with and without defects) underwent routine early postoperative follow-up assessment of the technical adequacy of their reconstruction using color duplex imaging; no residual defects were discovered. Two (2%) postoperative occlusions (one femorofemoral and one aortorenal bypass) occurred without a technical defect noted on reexploration. This clinical experience demonstrates that B-mode ultrasonography can supplement or replace preoperative arteriography in selected cases and is a valuable technique for identifying defects intraoperatively so that they can be immediately corrected.

##### Which blood test should be sent of following graft occlusion
1. Platelet count
2. Functional APC resistance
3. Protein S
4. Antithrombin III
5. Anticardiolipin


##### What percentage of early graft failures are due to technical error?
Despite us thinking to the contrary in earlier practice, we know believe that this accounts for less than 20%. The data suggests between 4 and 25%.
This data arises from the NSQIP patients and analysis. 

##### What are the risk factors for early graft occlusion?
Younger patients, particularly those <50 years have a higher incidence of early graft failure. These patients have been labelled or identified to have 'virulent disease' and this is a term used to describe an aggressive for of atherosclerosis that appears in young patients. Overall these patients have higher rates of graft occlusion, reoperation and amputation.

1. Below knee or distal/tarsal target
2. Secondary reconstructive procedures or re-do
3. Diabetes is protective (NSQIP) - more autogenous vein. Less tobacco use. Shorter grafts as aortoiliac and femoral are often spared.
4. Preoperative tissue loss
5. Greater BMI (35)
6. Primary assisted patency (ie needing early revisions)
7. Compromised distal arteries
8. Previously thrombectomised
9. Single vessel outflow
10. Dilator Less than 1mm
11. Venovenostomy, vein patched or prosthetic interposition
12. African American 
13. Higher Hct better- lower Hct associated with more graft failure. 

# What should younger patients undergo first?
Younger patients presenting with lifestyle limiting claudication or tissue loss should be evaluated for hypercoagulability before proceeding with revascularisation.

# What are the five elements to a good bypass?
1. Inflow
2. Outflow
3. Conduit
4. Operative technique
5. Coagulation profile

#### What's the percentage of early graft failure?
5 to 10% within 30 days of placement.

#### What will lyse better? Prosthetic or vein graft?
Prosthetic - but this is thought to be due to better run off that exists at the start

#### Which group of patients traditionally do poorly with thrombolysis?
Diabetics (this was established amongst the Dartmouth group).

#### What is a good strategy for early graft occlusion?
1. Immediately re-explore when possible. Thrombolysis is very high risk and improves patency 15 to 20%.
2. Attempt to thrombectomise and anticoagulate

#### What are the two most important factors in graft salvage with thrombolysis?
1. Graft age - older the better generally
2. Absence of diabetes
( Data from the Dartmouth group)

#### What are the results of endovascular treatment versus open treatment for hyper plastic lesions found after thrombolysis?
Similar results and outcomes can be expected. 
Some do suggest that vein patch or graft is better, but superiority is yet to be demonstrated.


##### Can you use contralateral vein?

##### What percentage of patients will need the contralateral limb revascularised?
Again, this data comes from the Dartmouth - Hithcock centre
20% will need contralateral extremity revascularisation at a mean of 31 months after initial ipsilateral bypass.
Therefore **it is roughly 6% per year**

The risk is lower if there is no atherosclerosis in the other limb. The risk is 10% in 5 years.

Based on these findings it could be argued that the contralateral vein can be used in elderly patients, especially if the atherosclerosis is remains isolated to one limb.

##### So what percentage of patients have unilateral atherosclerosis?
Only 8%

##### What's better? Arm vein or prosthetic vein (in terms of patency)
Study by Faries et al documented that autogenous arm vein demonstrated better patency that prosthetic for BK pop or tibial configurations
Therefore VEIN VEIN VEIN VEIN
